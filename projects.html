								It's this page. It's functional enough so far. The remaining part is something fancy for the homepage, I don't know what to put in though, and I want to work on more than just thinking about what to put in there. I learnt about Three.js existing, seems like it could be fun to experiment with. Might use it for something on the homepage. Might put random 3D models I make on it, just floating around. This projects page will be updated with projects I consider doing.
								Should also probably make everything responsive. I'll do it, soon.

								Found tutorials for it online. The Space Invaders one doesn't seem much like Space Invaders, more like a basic top-down shooter. I could make a mode to make it more like Space Invaders, and a normal mode to survive in. I could use it as a way to test some stuff before I add it into game1, well the basic stuff anyway.
								There're some more games in the tutorials, Pong and Flappy Bird are some of them. Will be useful to learn more about structure.

								I found a couple of tutorials for this in Python. This project also sounds like it could be a good starting point for VoiceApp1.

								The assistant does do some predefined actions, should make it do more useful stuff. Code needs some cleaning and improvement. Could look into how to making it work better with other apps.

								A game I started making using LibGDX and Java. A top-down bullet hell designed to be very hard and maybe very painful for some people to complete, I probably won't be able to complete it under normal means since I am not good at these types of games, so playtesting should be fun. Currently the player can move in 8 directions and shoot and use a "bomb" and die against a boss-like enemy that has 2 sets of attack sets. After making one level that works properly, I will need to refactor and rebuild the entire thing, the code is messier than spaghetti.
								This project is very demanding because I have a weird desire to want to create my assets for the game, with very little existing skill. This project will require me to learn the following:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Writing Good Code.
								</li>
								<li>
									Learn How To Do 2D Art.
								</li>
								<li>
									Learn How To Make/Edit Sound Effects.
								</li>
								<li>
									Learn How To Make Music.
								</li>
								<li>
									Learn How To Write Good, Or At Least Make A Story And Good Characters.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								This project will take a while to complete. I might put some pictures of some work in progress stuff here. Currently on hiatus because I want to do smaller projects to "heat up" before coming back to this.

								Even though this is called game2, out of the first 4 planned games, this is planned to be the last. I want this to have a higher quality than the others. This is more of a self-test of my abilities.
								I don't know what this will be built with. Unity, Godot, LibGDX, PyGame, PixiJS, threejs, maybe I'll try to make as much of it as I can. I haven't made much of a plan of the game yet, but I should start soon.
								The game is planned to try to be like a Metroidvania game, or at least some action, adventure game. It will be 2D and I will try to make it difficult. In terms of story, I'll make it linked to game1.

								A game I started making in Uni for my game development unit. The original idea for the game was maybe slightly too much work to do at the time and probably not worth it at the time, so I had to make many changes and heavily reduce the scope. This project is finishing the game to its original plan.
								This game is developed in Unity. It is a 3D game. The original plan was to make it a multiplayer zombie survival FPS similar to Call of Duty Zombies (I only played World at War, Black Ops1&2 so thats what I'll try to use as my reference). Originally it was planned to be multiplayer only with a non-survival solo mode, but then I realised that's a dumb idea and changed it to also have a solo mode. The multiplayer mode wouldn't have you working together with a partner, you'd be directly competing against them, or working together and competing.
								This project has a very similar problem to the other 4 games that were planned first, my weird obsession of wanting to create my assets for the game. This project will require me to learn the following:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Writing Good Unity Code.
								</li>
								<li>
									Learn How To Do 2D And 3D Art and Animations.
								</li>
								<li>
									Learn How To Make/Edit Sound Effects.
								</li>
								<li>
									Learn How To Make Music.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								This project will take a while to complete, original plan did have quite a few features. I might put some pictures of some work in progress stuff here.

								A game idea I came up with while I was watching a Unity tutorial that randomly showed up on my YouTube homepage.
								It's a small basic solo 3D Unity game. It is an endless runner where you must dodge, duck, jump, glide and dodge past obstacles on a path while collecting specific items. After collecting enough of the specific items, you'll be taken into a bullet hell area. I wonder how difficult I can make a 3D bullet hell...
								It should be no suprise that this game is also one where my unhealthy obsession with creating assets is also involved. But because I am planning on making this a more simple game in regards of assets, I will try to make the assets not as complicated as the other games.
							</p>
							<p>
								This will probably be the first personal project I will start work on when I start working with Unity again, or at least the endless runner part. Might help me learn things that would be helpful for game3.

								I don't know where I got the idea for this app. It might have just come to me randomly when I was interested with voice recognition and synthetic and artificial voices.
								The idea for this app is that it could do some things when given some speech input, mainly transcription, (rough) translation and maybe output it with a synthetic voice.

								Doing more art can help improve my art skills, and I could put some more into the game to make it look better. I would like my art to reach a good level, the difficulty of my games should be the thing that causes pain not the appearance. Also having more reference art and a 3D model of the main character would be helpful for some of the art in game4.

								I would like to try to create a horror experience, I call it an experience because it wouldn't be much of a game. Well it wouldn't be designed to be a game, just something the user can use to make them feel uncomfortable and on edge. I look forward to trying this. Should be fun, fun to make not necessarily fun for the person going through it.

								I would like to try to create some horror experiences, this will probably be my first one. Slender, well the original one, seems like a simple concept. Walk around, collect stuff, don't get caught, run, don't get caught. Would be nice to experiment and see if i can get some new ideas. I could also try to learn 3D modelling with this project, not just because of my unhealthy obsession, the bad quality could have a better effect at making the player uncomfortable. Would also be useful for game5 and game5Alt, which was originally designed to be kind of like a Slender clone but then grew to be quite messier.

						<div class = "projectDescription">
							<p>
								Its a Slender clone game. Less horror though. It's a bit more story focused, thats the only way I can justify the mess of what it is. It's single player. It starts off like Slender. Go walk about and collect stuff around the map and run and don't die while an angry thing is after you. If you get caught though, you aren't instantly dying, you just lose some progress as long as you have some items left on you. After you get all the items you need to head into a safe building because it seems like the thing chasing you isn't pleased with you surviving that long. Better defend yourself and call someone to pick you up.

								I did have a plan of making game5 into a multiplayer game when I was trying to come up with ideas for games for my game dev module in uni. I quickly decided no on this idea because I knew after few minutes of coming up with the idea, it's too big and it will hurt, too many features and complexity. So I may aswell do it after as a side project.
								The first version of the game I thought of would have just been a faster paced version of the first part of game5, the Slender copy part. Player 1 is the chased, Player 2 is the chaser. But new to this version, there would be a 3rd player to act as a guardian to even out the odds for the chased player. So basically the victim would be collecting items and running from the killer. The guardian would be able to provide some aid to the victim by either delaying the killer or boosting or hinting where an item is.

								The odd project out of the first bunch. All the others are more like making applications/games, this is the first one that focuses on web development, if you don't include this website. I learned how to use Laravel at my University for a web dev module. We did have a spec to follow but I wanted to experiment more with Laravel. So this project (if it can be called that), focuses on making a bunch of small templates for a variety of site examples. I kinda want to try my hand at learning how to make things like a dashboard and CMS.
