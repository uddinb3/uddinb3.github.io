                            About me: I like learning and working on a variety of stuff, as long as I have an interest in it. So far the things I am learning and working on include developing applications and games, how to do 2D and 3D art, how to edit audio well, and video editing.

                            About my tech skills: I have used a variety of languages. These languages include: HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Python, C# (from Unity) and Java. I have also gained some knowledge of using some frameworks like: LibGDX, Laravel, Magento, Flask and Konvajs. I am looking to expand my skillset.

                            I am currently trying to improve both my tech skills and my non-tech skills. Some tech skills I am currently learning are CSS animations and the Unity game engine. Some non-tech skills I am trying to learn more about are image editing and 2D art using GIMP and Krita, and video editing using KdenLive.
